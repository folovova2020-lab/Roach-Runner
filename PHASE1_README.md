## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.x
- Yarn
- MetaMask or compatible wallet
- Mumbai testnet MATIC (for deployment)

### Installation

```bash
# Install contract dependencies
cd /app/contracts
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd /app/frontend
yarn install
```

### Smart Contract Testing

```bash
cd /app/contracts
npm test
```

**Expected Output:**
```
  RaceContract
    ✔ Should create a race
    ✔ Should allow player to join race
    ✔ Should start race with enough players
    ✔ Should finalize race and credit winner
    ... (19 passing tests)
```

### Deploy to Mumbai Testnet

1. **Get Mumbai MATIC**
   - Faucet: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
   - Request: 0.5 MATIC minimum

2. **Configure Wallet**
   ```bash
   cd /app/contracts
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add:
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
   ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_key  # Optional
   ```

3. **Deploy Contract**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:mumbai
   ```

4. **Update Frontend Config**
   - Copy contract address from deployment output
   - Update `/app/frontend/.env`:
     ```
     EXPO_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
     ```

### Run Frontend

```bash
cd /app/frontend
yarn start

# For mobile testing:
# - Scan QR code with Expo Go app
# - Or press 'w' for web preview
```

## 📱 User Flow (Phase 1 MVP)

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - User opens app
   - Taps "Connect Wallet"
   - MetaMask/WalletConnect opens (currently simulated)
   - Wallet connected → Navigate to Lobby

2. **Place Bet & Select Roach**
   - Choose entry fee: 0.01, 0.05, or 0.1 MATIC
   - Select cockroach (#1-5)
   - View race info (pot size, winner payout)

3. **Start Race**
   - Tap "Start Race"
   - Transaction confirms bet on blockchain (simulated in MVP)
   - Navigate to race visualization

4. **Watch Race**
   - 5 cockroaches race across screen
   - Smooth animations with React Native Reanimated
   - Your selected roach highlighted
   - Race duration: ~5 seconds

5. **View Results**
   - Winner announced
   - If you won: See winnings (+MATIC)
   - If you lost: See bet amount (-MATIC)
   - Options: New Race or Back to Home

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Smart Contract Tests (Hardhat)
✅ Race creation with valid parameters
✅ Joining races with correct entry fee
✅ Starting races with minimum players
✅ Finalizing races and payouts
✅ Winner withdrawal
✅ Fee distribution (95% winner, 5% platform)
✅ Edge cases (invalid inputs, duplicate joins, etc.)

### Frontend Testing (Manual QA)
- [ ] Wallet connection flow
- [ ] UI responsiveness on different screen sizes
- [ ] Race animation smoothness
- [ ] State persistence across screens
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback

---

## 💰 Smart Contract Economics

**Entry Fees**
- Flexible: Set per race (0.01, 0.05, 0.1 MATIC in MVP)
- Paid in MATIC (Polygon native token)

**Payout Structure**
- Winner: 95% of total pot
- Platform fee: 5% of total pot
- Automatic distribution on race finalization

**Example:**
- 4 players × 0.1 MATIC = 0.4 MATIC pot
- Winner receives: 0.38 MATIC
- Platform collects: 0.02 MATIC

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Color Palette
- Background: #0a0a0a (Dark)
- Primary: #FFE66D (Gold/Yellow)
- Secondary: #4ECDC4 (Teal)
- Accent Colors: 
  - Roach #1: #FF6B6B (Red)
  - Roach #2: #4ECDC4 (Teal)
  - Roach #3: #FFE66D (Yellow)
  - Roach #4: #95E1D3 (Mint)
  - Roach #5: #F38181 (Pink)

### UI/UX Principles
- **Mobile-first**: Thumb-friendly touch targets (44x44 minimum)
- **Gamified**: Emojis, animations, visual feedback
- **Clear states**: Loading, success, error indicators
- **Minimal friction**: 3-step flow (connect → bet → race)

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations (MVP)

### Phase 1 Scope
✅ **Included:**
- Smart contract race logic
- Frontend race visualization
- Betting UI and flow
- Winner determination

⏳ **Not Yet Implemented:**
- Real WalletConnect integration (using simulated wallet)
- On-chain transaction signing (race outcomes simulated)
- Firebase race history storage
- Multi-player synchronization
- Chainlink VRF for provably fair randomness
- NFT cockroaches (Phase 2)
- DeFi features (Phase 3)
- AI commentator (Phase 4)

### Technical Debt
- Wallet connection is simulated (not using WalletConnect SDK yet)
- Race winner is client-side random (will use Chainlink VRF)
- No persistent storage (will add Firebase in next iteration)
- Single-player mode only (multiplayer needs backend orchestration)

---

## 📋 Next Steps: Phase 2

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Real Wallet Integration**
   - Implement WalletConnect v2
   - Add MetaMask deep linking
   - Test on actual Mumbai testnet

2. **On-Chain Transactions**
   - Sign and broadcast bet transactions
   - Listen for blockchain events
   - Update UI based on transaction status

3. **Firebase Integration**
   - Store race history
   - Real-time race updates
   - Player statistics and leaderboard

4. **NFT Layer** (Phase 2 Focus)
   - RoachNFT contract (ERC721)
   - Mint unique cockroaches
   - Cockroach attributes (speed, stamina, luck)
   - Accessory system (ERC1155)
   - IPFS metadata storage

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Contract Deployment Issues
**Problem:** "Insufficient funds for gas"
**Solution:** Get more Mumbai MATIC from faucet

**Problem:** "Transaction reverted"
**Solution:** Check PRIVATE_KEY has correct format (0x prefix)

### Frontend Build Issues
**Problem:** "Metro bundler error"
**Solution:** 
```bash
cd /app/frontend
rm -rf node_modules
yarn install
yarn start --clear
```

**Problem:** "Cannot resolve module"
**Solution:** Check all imports use correct paths
